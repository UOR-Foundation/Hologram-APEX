      "description": "Sigmatics is the canonical compiler foundation that powers Hologram. It implements a symbolic computation system built on 7 fundamental generators (mark, copy, swap, merge, split, quote, evaluate) and a 96-class resonance structure (≡₉₆). Through pattern-based canonicalization, Sigmatics reduces circuit operations to their minimal canonical forms, enabling the 4-8x performance gains Hologram achieves.",
      "relationship": "Sigmatics provides the formal algebraic specification that Hologram's compiler implements. Every Hologram operation compiles through Sigmatics' canonicalization rules to produce optimal generator sequences. The 96-class system and pattern rewriting (H²=I, X²=I, D³=I) are the mathematical foundation enabling Hologram's universal compute acceleration.",

      "tagline": "Rust formalization proving all 5 exceptional groups emerge from the Atlas",
      "description": "Atlas Embeddings demonstrates that all five exceptional Lie groups (G₂, F₄, E₆, E₇, E₈) emerge from a single initial object: the Atlas of Resonance Classes. The Atlas is a 96-vertex graph arising as the unique stationary configuration of an action functional—the same mathematical structure underlying Hologram's class system. Through categorical operations, this one structure generates the complete hierarchy of exceptional symmetries.",
      "relationship": "The Atlas provides the mathematical foundation for Hologram's 96-class memory system and resonance structure. Each of Hologram's 96 classes corresponds to a vertex in the Atlas graph. The action functional that produces the Atlas is the same principle ensuring Hologram's canonical forms are mathematically optimal. This research proves the deep mathematical correctness of Hologram's architecture.",
